\section{Introduction}
The minimum tardiness (scheduling) problem is defined as follows: given a single processor that has to process $n$ jobs $j_1,j_2,\dots,j_n$, where every job $j_i$ has a processing time/length $t_i$ and a due time $d_i$. Find a schedule that minimizes the total tardiness, i.e. $\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\max(0,c_i - d_i)}$, where $c_i$ is the completion time of job $i$.

For assignment 1 of the course Advanced Algorithms we had to implement both the exact dynamic programming algorithm given in \cite{exact} and the approximate algorithm (FPTAS) given in \cite{approx}.
